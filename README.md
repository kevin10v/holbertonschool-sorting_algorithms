# C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum. It focuses on implementing and understanding various **sorting algorithms** in the C programming language, and analyzing their **Big O time complexities**.

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Implement at least **four different sorting algorithms** in C
- Analyze the **time complexity** of an algorithm using **Big O notation**
- Select the **best sorting algorithm** for a given input and scenario
- Understand what makes an algorithm **stable**
- Work with both **arrays** and **doubly linked lists** in sorting context

📜 Requirements
Language: C (compiled with gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89)

Style: Betty (code style and documentation)

No global variables

No standard library functions (e.g., no printf, puts, etc.)

Each function in its own file (≤ 5 functions per file)

All function prototypes must be in sort.h

Include guards in all header files

You must print the array/list every time a swap happens (as required per algorithm)
